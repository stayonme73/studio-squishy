# The Studio — architecture

**Service Catalog** (`src/catalog/`, import via `@/catalog`) is the single source of truth for services, deliverables, pricing, dependencies, categories, service class (signature / core / essential), discovery triggers, and governance fields. `StudioServiceEntry` (schema v2) is the canonical shape; `ServiceCatalogEntry` remains an alias for Recommendation Engine compat. **Recommendation Engine** (`src/recommendation/`, import via `@/recommendation`) reads Discovery answers and the catalog, applies deterministic rules, and produces the approved recommendation object. **Discovery Summary Model** (`src/discovery-summary/`, import via `@/discovery-summary`) maps `RecommendationResult` into customer-facing view-model copy — titles, explanations, investment labels, timeline, next-step CTA, and warnings — without re-scoring or duplicating catalog rules. Downstream pages consume the Campaign Record — they do not rebuild business logic.

**No business logic in UI components.** Components render data they receive. They do not decide what services to recommend, what deliverables exist, or how pricing is calculated. Keep business rules in the Service Catalog and Recommendation Engine; keep customer-facing presentation copy in the Discovery Summary Model.

**Faithful implementation.** From this point forward, faithfully implement the architecture already designed. If a business rule appears missing, ask before creating one — do not invent business rules independently.

**Architecture freeze.** After the Service Catalog foundation (schema v2), freeze the architecture:

- No more renaming things
- No more changing terminology
- No more moving fields around
- Changes only when a real customer exposed a flaw, or the business genuinely evolved
